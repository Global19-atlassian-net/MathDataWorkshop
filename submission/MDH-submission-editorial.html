<h1 id="submissioneditorial-process-for-mathdatahub-first-thoughts">Submission/Editorial Process for MathDataHub (First Thoughts)</h1>
<p>This is a working document capturing the discussions at the <a href="https://opendreamkit.org/2019/08/17/WorkshopOnDataInMathematics/">Math Data Workshop</a>.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>The <a href="htp://mdhalpha.mathhub.info">MathDataHub System (MDH)</a> collects Mathematical Data sets. The data sets are described formally via a</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>schema theory, that describes the database schema and its relation to the mathematics</li>
<li>a (flexible) formalization of the mathematical background theory, and a</li>
<li>set of codecs that mediate between the database level in 1. and the mathematical level in 2. programmatically.</li>
<li>a formalization of dataset provenance.</li>
<li>a human-readable (i.e. natural language; usually English) document that describes all of the above to the human readers.</li>
</ol>
<p>Given such a description, MDH generate a database extension and an importer from a JSON (or soon CSV) file that contains the dataset data in structured form.</p>
<h2 id="this-document">This document</h2>
<p>describes the process for dataset submission (technical) and the editorial process (mathematical) for MDH.</p>
<h2 id="people-involved-and-their-roles">People involved and their Roles</h2>
<p>There are five kinds of roles in MDH (there may be more, but these suffice for this document)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Developers</strong> who create and maintain the system code, data structure, and user interfaces. Currently Katja Bercic and Tom Wiesing.</li>
<li><strong>Knowledge Engineers</strong> who create flexiformalizations and codecs. Currently, Dennis Müller, Florian Rabe, and Michael Kohlhase</li>
<li><strong>Dataset Authors</strong> who create datasets, specify the mathematical objects involved, and provide provenance.</li>
<li><strong>Editors</strong> who organize the mathematical evaluation of the data set and the technical creation of the formal submission.</li>
<li><strong>Readers</strong> who use the MDH system to gain knowledge about the mathematical objects.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first four categories contribute to the submission and editorial processes.</p>
