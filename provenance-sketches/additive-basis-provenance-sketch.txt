1. Theory behind the data

MSC2010 classification:
11B13   	Additive bases, including sumsets

[except that they only talk about infinite bases, target = all N]


1.1 generic:
An additive basis is [link to definition in sTeX]

NOTE: This is a very generic definition. Both the basis and the target set
could be infinite (cf. Goldbach conjecture: primes and even integers)
and the elements might not be integers (e.g. they could be points in
the plane, Kohonen-Koivunen-Rajamäki 2018)

1.2 more specific:
Here we talk about additive bases that
* are finite (have k elements, where k is positive integer)
* have nonnegative integers as elements
* whose order is 2   [= taking sums of 2 elements]
* whose target set is an interval of nonnegative integers [0,n]

1.3 even more specific:
An OPTIMAL additive basis [of our current type] is one that,
for a given size, has the longest target interval.

NOW we have a specific mathematical question that our data answers:
Given integer k, WHAT are the optimal additive bases [of our type]?


2. Process of generating the current data

Search algorithm described in Kohonen & Corander (2014)
Implemented in C by JK
Program code available by request from author [SHOULD BE made public]
Program is standalone, no extra libraries needed

Program was run in parallel on 2.6 GHz AMD Opteron processes,
on CSC/Finland computer cluster
Memory requirement was small [... MB, did not originally report it]

Running time: for k=25 it was 606 days [reported in article].
For smaller k it is faster [not reported in article]




Reproducibility:
Given the program code, it is easy to rerun the program if you have
the computing power available. The program is deterministic so you
will have identical results every time.


3. Discussion of the validity of the data

[Not discussed in the original article!]

Suppose k=25 (number of elements) is given.  If we are given an
additive basis of k=25 elements, it is easy to compute its target set
(set of pairwise sums).

EASY to verify {0,1,3,4,...,103,105,106} is an additive basis for
[0,212].

DIFFICULT to verify that there are no 25-element bases that have
greater range of the target interval.  Basically have to rerun the
program and

* trust that the algorithm & implementation are correct
* the machine works

so that we did not miss anything.

It is difficult to think of a succint "certificate" of the correctness
in this problem.

Imaginable errors in the data: If the program or the run was incorrect,
there could be bases that have GREATER range.
